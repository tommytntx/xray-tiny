# Xray for ARMv5 (armel) â€” UPX Compressed Build

This repository provides **precompiled Xray binaries** for legacy ARMv5 (armel) devices.  
The binaries are statically built with Go, stripped of debug symbols, and compressed with [UPX](https://upx.github.io/) to minimize size.  
They are intended for constrained environments where storage space is limited (e.g., 128 MB flash).
